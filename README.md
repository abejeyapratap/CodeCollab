# CodeCollab

Note: All developers have a file called `nodemon.json` in the root directory `/` that contains secret keys that is required to run the app (should have been sent to you separately).

## Dependencies

Run `npm install` in root directory `/` and `my-app/`
Both angular and the server must be running for the app to function correctly

## Local Testing
### Angular

Run `ng serve` in `my-app/` to start the Angular development server
Angular runs on `localhost:4200` - This is where you can view the app

### Server

Run `npm run dev` to start the Node server
The server runs on `localhost:3000`

## Production
Run `ng build --configuration production`
